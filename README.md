# csgorolltest

1. To run the test navigate to the mdc folder which is the root, and run "npm i" to install the required packages. Then in the same folder run the command "npm run cypress".
2. I created 8 tests that successfuly pass, which you can see in the screenshots and the video sent to you. Find all the tests in the mdc/packages/app-e2e/src/e2e folder in the dice-roll.cy file.
3. The test where I tried to intercept the request and mock the data wasn't completed because, for some reason, none of the requests couldn't be intercepted, which I got from debugging the code as well as getting the message from the cy.wait(alias) method which returned that the request was never even called upon. But the code is still available on the repo, and I am willing to discuss this task with you in a live interview as well.

Kind regards!
